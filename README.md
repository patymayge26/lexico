# introduction

Lexical analysis is a fundamental stage in the construction of compilers and interpreters, since it is responsible for decomposing the source code of a program into lexical units or "tokens". These tokens represent the most basic components of the programming language, such as identifiers, keywords, literals, and operators.

The main objective of the "Lexical Analyzer" program is to identify and separate these tokens into an input text following predefined lexical rules. This is essential for post-processing of source code, such as parsing and intermediate code generation.

# EncontrarURL.java

# introduction

In today's digital age, web addresses or URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) are a fundamental part of Internet browsing. Whether building web applications or analyzing text online, the ability to detect and extract URLs from a dataset is an important task.

The "Find URLs" program we present aims to identify and extract URLs within a provided text. This is especially useful when you want to automate the search for web links in documents or web pages, or when you need to perform online content analysis.

# Correo.java

# introduction

"The 'Mail' program is a tool designed to verify the validity of email addresses. In today's digital age, email is a fundamental form of communication, and ensuring that the email addresses provided are valid is essential to maintaining effective and accurate communication.

This program uses regular expressions and Java to evaluate whether a text string represents a valid email address. The regular expression used follows a set of specific rules to determine whether an email address meets the Common Standards.

# Numtel.java

# introduction

"The 'NumMex' program is a tool designed to verify if an entered phone number follows the typical Mexican format. Currently, phone numbers follow different patterns depending on the country, and validating these numbers is critical to ensure their accuracy and usefulness in applications and systems that require valid contact details.

This program uses Java and regular expressions to evaluate whether a text string representative of a phone number matches the format commonly used in Mexico. The typical format of a phone number in Mexico includes an optional area code in parentheses, followed by an optional blank space, followed by a local number and a hyphen (-) followed by an extension number.

# introduction

The program "StateMachineExample" is an example that illustrates the concept of a state machine using the Java programming language. State machines are programming models that represent the behavior of a system as a collection of states, transitions, and actions associated with those states.

In this example, an enumeration called "State" is used to represent the possible states of a fictitious machine. Each state has an associated description that provides information about its role. The enumeration defines states as "OFF", "ON", "EN_ESPERA", and "RESTARTING".
